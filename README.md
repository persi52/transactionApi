## Description
There are some cases that I prefer to mention not to seem such newbie :)

Database configuration I used wouldn't always be suitable for production.
I could host database somewhere for ex. on Heroku but I hope that was not the point of task.
I wouldn't normally commit .env file to the repo, I do it knowing that it can 
make testing easier with just inserting own database credentials.
